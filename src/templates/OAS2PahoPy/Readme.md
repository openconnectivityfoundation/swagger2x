# Template: PAHO MQTT OCF server

## Introduction

The template generates application level code for the OCF over MQTT using paho mqttt.
The generated code acts as a OCF Server acting as a simulator.
e.g. the server does not have code to interact with the sensors/actuators.
However the generated code stores the send information and returns the data on request.
The generated code is a good start to hook up all the hardware that that the product will contain.
